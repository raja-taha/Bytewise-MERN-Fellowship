            <h3>Adaptations for Cold</h3>
            <p>
              Polar bears have thick fur and a layer of fat beneath their skin
              that insulates them against the freezing Arctic temperatures.
              Their fur is not actually white but transparent and reflects
              visible light, giving them their characteristic white appearance.

            <h3>Exceptional Swimmers</h3>
            <p>
              Polar bears are powerful swimmers, capable of covering long
              distances in search of food. Their large, slightly webbed paws
              make them excellent swimmers, helping them navigate the icy waters
              of the Arctic.

            <h3>Powerful Hunters</h3>
            <p>
              As apex predators, polar bears have developed remarkable hunting
              skills. They primarily hunt seals, waiting patiently by breathing
              holes to catch their prey. Their sense of smell is so acute that
              they can detect a seal nearly a mile away.
