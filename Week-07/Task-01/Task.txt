* Setting up JWT in your Express application
* Creating and signing JWTs
* Verifying and decoding JWTs
* Implementing protected routes and middleware for authentication

📝 Submission:
Follow along with the tutorial and implement JWT authentication in your existing projects. Save your work in the folder and upload it to your GitHub repository. The deadline for submission is at the end of the week.

Happy coding!
