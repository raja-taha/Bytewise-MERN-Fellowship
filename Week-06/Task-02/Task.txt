⭕ Hey Fellows,

I hope you’re all progressing well with Express! Today, we’ll be focusing on integrating MongoDB with your Express applications and interacting with REST APIs. This will enable you to create dynamic, data-driven web applications.

🚩 Tasks for the Day:

- Watch the following playlist to learn about MongoDB connection and interacting with REST APIs: (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTMNWTDdd5z_CtvbzG6r1f4hjnCaphPTV)

📖 What you'll learn:
